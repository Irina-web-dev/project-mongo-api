# Mongo API Project

The goal of this project is to build an API using Node.js and Express, store the data on MongoDB and query that data from the API. The database is modelled and manipulated using mongoose.

## The problem

The biggest challenge for this project was to get my database to work on MongoDB Atlas and to connect it to Heroku server app. I followed all the steps provided, but it was not working until I added environment variables into Config Vars on Heroku. I once again StackOverflow halped me to solve this.

## View it live

You can find this API live on Heroku: https://books-base.herokuapp.com/
